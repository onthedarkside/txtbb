Using txtBB is pretty straightforward: Sign up for a webhosting (you
only need PHP support, most offer that). Upload the files in the txtBB
folder in a folder you want to access your forum at. Do a few clicks 
for configuration. 

INSTALL
=======

1. Choose where you want to access the forum files (all the files and 
folders in the folder txtBB). Upload them to your home directory
(usually "public_html", sometimes just what you reach after login in
via FTP) if all your site is the forum, or make a subdirectory (for 
example "forum" or "txtbb" and upload them there). If your page was 
http://mypage.com, and the folder for txtBB was forum, the adress of your
forum would be http://mypage.com/forum/

2. Do file permissions via FTP. All files, in directories or not, as well
as the directory your forum is in ("forum" in our example) need to have
permission 766 (or 777 if this fails). 

3. Answer the installation questions. If the adress of your forum is
http://mypage.com/forum/, the address of the installation page is 
http://mypage.com/forum/install.php. Install PHP is deleted automatically
after finishing the install (just answer all the questions). If it is
still present on your server, delete it, as anyone could screw the 
installation with this. Keep a local copy of it if you ever need to restore
your forum from a backup.

4. The first user who registers is admin! So register as soon as possible
before some troll/ cracker/ spammer does. To do so, just visit your
forum page and register as any normal user would do. Some hosters display
PHP warnings, don't care if the install works and you can sign up (be sure
all the permissions are correct). After correct installation and setting
all the permissions to 766/ 777, you should no longer receive warnings.

5. Go to the admin control panel and configure the settings. 

BACKUP
======

Backing up your forum is very easy: Just download the forum folder via
FTP. Some FTP clients will even allow you to synchronize two directory
so you won't have a bunch of backups on your computer but one folder you
keep up to date every few days or such.

If you loose the forum on your website, just make a new forum folder, 
copy install.php in your backup, delete global.php (contains old 
settings) upload all the files and run install.php
once again (after giving the permissions, i.e. 766 or 777 again, as they
are most likely lost). Go to your forum page and login with your 
old admin account. Should still work. That's about it.

USER PROXY SETTINGS
===================

In the admin settings panel, you can force users to use a proxy, allow
certain IP adresses or forbid weak, security compromising proxies (even
if you do not enforce proxy usage). 

If you run a page where some of your users might get in trouble if their
identitity is revealed, you might choose to force them to use a proxy, 
i.e. hide their real IP address.
At the moment, the Tor network (free to use, https://torproject.org) is
the most promising approach to anonymity. Tor isn't perfect, but pretty
good - so Tor IP's are automatically allowed if you enforce proxy usage.
Users might just download the Tor browser or install Tor (works on Android
and IPhone even) to browse your website.

Then there are weak proxies. These usually are proxy websites. They 
allow students to watch Youtube in their school library where Youtube
is blocked, but they don't offer actual anonymity and tend to log 
traffic and cooperate with officials. This often is much, much worse 
than no proxy at all. Plus, they often simply stop working without 
users noticing.
Even if you do not enforce proxy usage, think of disallowing them! Most
likely not all are caught (sorry about that), but a lot of them.

If you enforce a proxy, some users might complain about not being able
to access the forum despite using a proxy. This is the case for VPN
connections: VPN providers give users their IP address. On your redirect
page, there should be for example your mail adress of a simple contact
form, where users can tell you their VPN's IP. Research if you trust
the provider in the context of your forum. If so, go to your backup,
and open the file vpn_allow.txt in the folder "vpnallow" in a text editor
(such as Notepad on Windows, or the [free to use] editors Notepad++ or
Geany). Enter the IP of the VPN (sometimes there are several IPs) and 
close the file again. Each line should only contain ONE IP adress. Upload
the file to your server, i.e. overwrite the current vpn_allow.txt.
This step involves manual editing because you should think well about
which VPN you should trust. 

The page you redirect users who have been blocked to might include:
a) Info about what kind of proxy they should use. "No weak proxy/ proxy
website", Tor or such.
b) (If you don't get spammed) a mailadress, or contact form, so users
can tell your their VPN provider so you can set the IP(s) on the list 
in vpn_allow.txt
c) A tutorial how to use an allowed proxy (most likely Tor) if you 
enforce proxy usage.
