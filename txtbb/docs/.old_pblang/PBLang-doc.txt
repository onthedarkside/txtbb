PBLang - Documentation

Date: 25th September 2003 - version 4.6

-------------------------------------
Before installing this board: Please read the file copyright.txt very carefully!
It is important that you understand that I take no responsible for anything that is
caused, directly or indirectly, by the use of this program. In other words:

You use this program at your own risk!!!

Beyond this, I feel it is very important that you do not remove or alter the
single line copyright notice which in a way honours my work. I think that's the
least I can request from you. It is just not right if you put your name behind
the copyright sign, giving the impression that you did the work that I did for you.
It is of course ok and no problem if you add a link to your site, or your name
or whatever to the footer.
Commercial sites I request to donate via the Paypal button at least 20 US$
towards the development of this board. Private persons may feel free to donate,
as it seems appropriate. All users are treated equally with regard to support,
which is performed through the support board at the location indicated at the
end of this file. In certain situations and if time permits, I am even willing
to help via chat, or by other appropriate means.

***********************************************************************************
***   For updaters: please read the relevant sections below very carefully!!!   ***
***********************************************************************************

PBLang bases on the PHP source of Powerboard, the development of which has
been stopped in the middle of 2002 in favour of a commercial package.
Since then, the board has been largely modified and extended. There
is not much left over except for the idea to use a flat file system
(there is absolutely no database like mySQL involved).
It is a forum which allows localization by the use of language files.

This documentation is intended for admins who need to install and edit the
board to suit their purposes. I discourage strongly to edit the source,
unless you know  exactly what you are doing!
This is mainly because it will be very difficult to benefit of any future
updates. If you have a good idea, let me know, I'll incorporate it, or I'll
advise you how you can implement it. I would request that you send the
results of your own modifications to me, so that I can include them in the
full package.

===========================================
I - Installation or update procedures
===========================================
(this is probably the most important section for EVERYONE!)

I.a - Preparation
------------------

If you are new to PBLang, take a look at the readme-first file! It *is*
important. For PBLang to run, you have to make files and directories
writeable. For installation, all directories must be writeable to all (chmod
666; you can also set them to chmod 777).
Run install.php. It will check if there are any files or folders which are
missing or not supplied with the appropriate rights. You need to re-run the
install program after fixing the reported problems, because certain parts of
the installation couldn't take place.

The following directories must be writeable (chmod 777):

/db and all subdirectories
/attachments if you want to allow attachments (you may need to create this
	folder)
/templates/pb/images/ranks

-----------------------------------------------------------------
I.b - For those who update from any previous version (PBLang, NewPB or
	powerboards):
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Run install.php, it will check if everything has been set properly and
	inform you of any problems.

2. Go to the admin control center, set your options and submit them. Even if
you do not want to do any changes, save them. This will add new settings
variables which are required for a proper functioning of the board. In some
sections there will be new options which you should set the first time.

Your previous data should be safe. If your previous version is less than 3.0,
you must now follow instructions for updating from PBLang (3.0).

-------------------------------------------------------
I.c - For those who update from a previous version of PBLang (3.0 up to 4.1)
-------------------------------------------------------

1. Make a backup of all relevant data which sits in the db-directory and all
its subdirectories. There is now a backup/restore program available, called
backup.php and restore.php. To use it, create these directories:
	db/backup
	db/backup/posts
	db/backup/cats
	db/backup/members
and give them 666 rights. Then run the backup program. This will save all
your old data. Make sure to remove the restore.php program, otherwise anyone
can execute it and create a horrible scenario on your system.
2. Set the forum into maintenance mode, and make sure nobody is logged in.
2a. Check the folders
db/posts
db/cats
for any illegal files. Illegal files could be e.g.
__1 (first numbers missing, should be e.g. 1_1_1)
Don't try to fix them, these messages never appeared in the forum and are
useless. Remove them from the folder. Files which belong there are index.html
and .htaccess, so keep them there.
3. Copy all updated files to the directory where your forum is located. Make
sure that you also copy the updated files from subdirectories to their
respective locations! There are a number of new images, updated language
files etc.
4. Run install.php and delete it afterwards (usually, it deletes itself after
successful installation). You will need to add some information during
installation process.
5. Make the lang files in the directory templates/pb/language/ writeable, if
you plan on changing them.
6. If you are updating from version 3.x, run the update.php file. If you
are updating from version 4.0 or 4.1, run the update-1.php file and then the
update-2.php file. These two programs you must run also if you update from
version 3.x. So, in a nutshell, the steps are as follows -
* Update from version 3.x:
	update.php
	update-1.php
	update-2.php
*Update from version 4.0 and 4.1:
	update-1.php
	update-2.php
7. Log in and check if members are listed properly in the memberlist. If so,
delete update.php - it must not be accessible to anyone else but you.
Then check if all messages appear intact. if so, remove update-1.php and
update-2.php.
If you find that the data hasn't been updated properly, please contact
me through the support forum or via email. Do not attempt to run the
update programs more than once! Do not allow users to access the forum,
if the update didn't perform as expected.
8.Go to the admin center and select the forum settings. Save it, even if you
haven't done any changes. Now your version should be indicated as 4.5
9. You should be done.
See also the changes in filestructure (section I.e)!

I.d - System Requirements
----------------------------

PBLang doesn't need much: it requires support for cookies, and it runs
only on servers which support PHP. That's all. Javascript is used, but
not required - it works also without.

I.e - The following changes in file structure have taken place:
--------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.5 to version 3.0:
templates/pb/admin.php is no longer needed
templates/pb/usercp.php is no longer needed
templates/pb/images/buttons is no longer needed
All doc-files go into the docs-directory

Higher than version 3.0:
error.php is no longer needed
viewcats.php is obsolete
db/getdate.php is no longer needed
db/menu.php is no longer needed (was never needed)
templates/pb/header.php is no longer needed
templates/pb/footer.php is no longer needed
templates/pb/stats.php is no longer needed

Attention:
styles.php has been moved. It is no longer in the templates/pb-folder.
You find it now in the db/settings/styles-folder, where you would expect it.

Higher than version 4.1:
admstyles.php has been newly created
admsettings.php has been newly created

templates/pb/images/butt/contrablue is no longer used
templates/pb/images/butt/silver is no longer used
templates/pb/images/butt/textonly is no longer used
all subfolders in templates/pb/images/icon are no longer used
templates/pb/images/top/ar_grey is no longer used
templates/pb/images/top/XP is no longer used

Higher than version 4.65:
search is no longer needed

I.f - Other Specialities
------------------------

When you install PBLang, you will notice a button in the top-right corner
showing "Paypal - Donate". If you click this button, you will be taken to
a page of Paypal, through which you can contribute financially to the
further development of PBLang.
You are not required to do so, but it would be a nice gesture to honour the
hundreds of hours that have gone into developing this software and to
encourage the ongoing development process. If you want to invite the
members of your board to do so, too, just leave it. If you don't want to,
empty the file "donation.php" completely. You could also enter a URL to
your own image, however you need to use PHP-code. Do not delete this
file, it would cause an errormessage. See the comments in this file as well.

I.g - Language Installation
--------------------------
If the language of your country is not available in the package, you need to
check if it is available for download at the website at
http://PBLang.drmartinus.de/
and install it yourself.
However, installation is easy:
Just copy the files in these packages to the directories in which they are
already located in the archive, and you are done. The directories in the
archives are subdirectories of the directory

templates/pb/

The contents of the images folder in the archive belongs therefore into

templates/pb/images

and so on. The new language will be available for selection from within
the admin center and the user control panel, as well as from the
install-program and registration program.

==========================================
II - How to use PBLang
==========================================

(this section isn't complete and will be filled as required)

II.a - After installation
-------------------

After installation, you should immediately register yourself. The first
member gets admin status automatically. Then go into the admin control
panel, and set the forum according to your preferences. These things are
most important:

Enter a valid email-address for the admin (you), so you can be notified when
a new user has been registered, and for other purposes.
If - which is sometimes the case - your server doesn't support the PHP mail
function, disable the checkbox "mail supported by server". This will
make the useful function of email notification useless, which is a pity.
Ask your ISP whether he can allow you to use the mail function for this
purpose. Some ISPs turn it off because it's misused for mass mailing.

After you have become admin, log in and start creating categories.
A category is a supersection which contains the actual forums. The
forums are the places where the discussions take place. So plan
your board accordingly. Have a look at the support forum to know how
a board is organized.
Once you created the categories, create also forums whithin the categories.
Once you have created the forums, people can begin to post messages.


II.b - Maintenance Mode
----------------------

If you set the board into maintenance mode, because you are updating it,
and log out, you won't be allowed to log in. A simple way to bypass this
limitation is to run "login.php" instead of "index.php" when accessing the
board. You can only use the board if you are the admin, while it is in
maintenance mode.

II.c - Deletion of posts
-----------------------

Basically, deletion means deletion. I.e. the message that is to be deleted,
will be completely gone. So use this feature with care!

While replies can be deleted at any position by the author or the admin
and moderator, a post with replies cannot be deleted by its author, but
only by the admin. This is because the author of a post that initiated
responses should not be able to delete his or her message, otherwise, it
would be difficult to find out to what the people actually replied. When
the admin wants to delete this first message, (s)he must be aware that
with this, the entire thread will be deleted. This is sometimes necessary.
There is the equal function at the bottom of the thread. Since the deletion
takes place physically, and counters will be reset, it may take some
time, depending on how many replies are there.

II.d - Guest Account
------------------------

If you want any user to be able to post without any identification, you
can create a guest account and invite users to use this account. However,
keep in mind that this is a way which allows all kinds of misuse -
eventually you'll be held responsible for the contents of your website!

II.e - Styles and Colors
---------------------------

PBLang supports multiple sets of colors and styles. But when you select a
predefined set, your existing set will be overwritten. You can avoid that
by copying the file "templates/pb/styles.php" to the directory
db/settings/styles. There you rename it to something meaningful which
reminds you of what it looks like, like "yellow_desert.php". Next time
you call up predefined styles, this file will be on the list. Send me your
styles.php file, So I can include it in the distribution package!

With version 4.5, some improvement was made: Each style can have its
own set of buttons. Buttonsets have a particular prefix which is set in
the "styles and colors" section of the adminCP. You just enter this prefix
into the field, and all the buttons appear in the selected design, provided
they exist in the default language of your board. If they don't, default
buttons will be selected. If you don't want that, you may have to choose
English as the default language of your board. An example prescript is
"ar_grey_", which is the style currently used in the support forums.

II.f - Deletion of Forums and Categories
---------------------------

To delete a forum, you need to enter a forum as admin and then click on
the link at the right bottom of the page "Delete forum". This will remove
the entire forum, including all topics!
So use this function with great care!
To delete a category, you first must delete all forums in this category. If
you had deleted forums before the release of the version "Phoenix", you'll
have to rename the forums again in the admin center to give them another
name than "delplz", so that they become visible again. Then you can delete
them properly. After all forums are deleted, you select the option "delete
category" in the admin center.

=========================================
III - The Admin Control Panel
=========================================

A - News and Version Comparison
________________________

Here you have the possibility to check if your version is the latest.
This page links to two files on my server at http://www.drmartinus.de. Some
hosts do not allow scripts to access other sites, in this case it is good
not to open this page of the Admin center. In this case I strongly
recommend that you subscribe yourself to the Announcement list, where new
versions of PBLang are announced.
If your host allows scripts to check other websites, you'll get latest info
and a version comparison by selecting this page, making it easy for you to
find out if a new version is available. There is also a link to the project
page, from where you get directly to the support forum, if you need to get
help.
The version comparison has been improved to also take into account if
you use a beta or testing version.

B - Forum Settings
_______________


III.B.a - Announcement option
--------------------------

In PBLang Phoenix, the new option to make an announcement has been
introduced. The announcement will be displayed in a box below the header
and above the list of forums. It can be configured in the admin center.
In the text box which contains the text for the announcement, you can use
simple HTML. If the HTML tag contains quotes, use single quotes only,
otherwise the text will be distorted. If you leave the box empty, no
announcement box appears.

III.B.b - Server supports Email by PHP
----------------------------------

Some webservers do not allow email by PHP. This is especially relevant
when the server is based on Windows. In this case, to avoid errormessages,
it is good to uncheck this option. You know that your server does not support
EMail by PHP if you get an error message like "undefined function mail() ....".

In order to bypass this problem, a function has been built into 4.55 which
allows using a SMTP server. However, this function must be set manually:

You must edit admsettings.php: the line (around No. 129) reading

echo "<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"smtpmail\" value=\"0\">";

must be changed to

echo "<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"smtpmail\" value=\"1\">";

Simultaneously you must (!) disable the email support via PHP. Also,
edit the file db/settings/sendmail.php with your data. Note that your
password must be entered in plain text, but the file sendmail.php can not
be accessed by other users, so it should be safe.
Go to the admin center and select forum settings, then save the settings,
even if you didn't change anything. This will make sure that smtp-mail
is enabled.
Try it out, this function isn't official yet, let me know if it works.

III.B.c - Automatic emails
----------------------

In the forum settings in the admin control center, there is an option to allow
automatic emails. This refers to the email that is sent to new users at
registration time and welcomes the user. This is overridden by the option
"Server supports email by PHP", i.e. when the server does not support
email by PHP and this option is turned off, it doesn't matter if automatic
emails are enabled or not, it won't have an effect.

III.B.d - Allowing Attachments
----------------------

Previously, attachments were either allowed or forbidden. Now, if you allow
attachments to be uploaded, you have the possibility to select which file types
should be allowed. This can be helpful if you handle certain filetypes which were
not included by default.
Keep in mind that all sorts of executeable files can cause great damage,
particularly when they are executeable by the webserver, like html and php
files, java programs etc. So you should not allow those. Files without an
extension are generally allowed (as long as you allow attachments to be
uploaded).

III.C - Members
____________

III.C.e - Grant status
-----------------------

You can grant members a particular status. This status will not be affected
by the amount of messages a member has posted. The statuses have the
following privileges:

admin - the member can do everything
moderator - the moderator can edit and delete messages in a forum, and can
	lock a topic. The moderator can not delete a topic or a forum, and may not
	alter or delete an administrator's post
friend - currently no special privilege

===================================================
IV - Tools
===================================================

IV.A - GetLatestMessage.php
*****************************

The file GetLatestMessage.php contains a function which is suitable to
create a list of latest posts on another website. You'll have to first include
the file in a PHP-file like

include ('GetLatestMessage.php');

Note: The file itself must be in the directory from where it is called!

Then you can call the function GetLatestMessage() as follows:

$LastMsg=GetLatestMessage(string URL,string path,int noofmessage);

e.g.:

$LastMsg=GetLatestMessage('www.myurl.de/forum','/home/htdocs/myacc/html/forum',0);

$LastMsg will be an array containing the following values:

$LastMsg[URL] -> The URL wihtout "http://"
$LastMsg[subj] -> The subject line of the message
$LastMsg[auth] -> The author's name

A way to use these values would be:

echo '<a href="http://'.$LastMsg[URL].'" TARGET="NEU">'.$LastMsg[subj].'</a>
by '.$LastMsg[auth].';

<int noofmessage> means: 0 is the newest, 1 the second, 2 the third and so on.

If you want to create a list of more than one message, you need to check
for duplicates, maybe like this:

for ($i=1;$i<=10;$i++){
$PrevMsg=$CurrentMsg;
$CurrentMsg=GetLatestMessage('www.myurl.de/forum','/home/htdocs/myacc/html/forum',0);
if ($PrevMsg!=$CurrentMsg){
	[your code to display the message link comes here]
}
}
