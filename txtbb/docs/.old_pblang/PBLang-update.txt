Important hints for an update:

1 - There is a new function in the admin center (board settings) to specify
	the target of forms. So, if the board is within a frame, the target should
	be named accordingly. Note that this function existed already, but just as
	a "yes/no" option (whether in frames or not). Now you must enter a target
	name. If there are no frames, "_self" will be fine.
2 - if you used the censoring function, you can now define the words to
	be censored manually from within the admin center. You should do that,
	since otherwise the list will be empty.
3 - You need to check in the admin settings the target for framesets. If
	you don't use framesets, the field should contain "_self" (without quotes),
	otherwise it should contain the name of the frame in which PBLang  is
	positioned (This was already available sonce 4.65a)

Notes for translators:
1 - There are a few variables which have been rephrased. Please check.
	They are dated 20 Oct 2004 or later
