PBLang - Version 4.6 - update history

If you are planning to update from a previous version of PBLang, i.e. a
version lesser than 4.5, you have to read the PBLang-doc.txt and follow
the update instructions very carefully! Otherwise, you might destroy the
data that so far has been posted in your forum!

release date:

A lot of work has gone into this release, and much I have to thank the help of
others, which are now called the PBLang-Team, since the number is growing... :-)

-------------------------
Fixed bugs (among many) version 4.0:
-------------------------

1. HTML-coding improved or rectified
2. After writing a pm, the software returned to the "new pm" screen instead
     of the pm-list
3 - admin center returns now after action to the respective section in which the
     changes were done (this wasn't really a bug, but now it's more comfortable)
4 - Handling of quotes in subject lines has been fixed
5 - removing a member while that member is logged in caused problems - now a
     member cannot be removed as long as (s)he is logged in.

***********************************************************
New in version 4.5:
-----------------------

1 - File system changed: now, infos on categories are stored in one file for
     each category
2 - File system changed: infos on forums are stored in one file for each forum.
     This helps increasing speed and reducing space usage (PBLang used
     10 files until now - a legacy probem).
3 - File system changed: posts are now stored completely in one file each.
     It's a similar issue like all other changes so far.
4 - increased security - avoiding javascript code injection
5 - The latest posts can be listed - admin decides how many
6 - Search function improved (particularly speed)
7 - Admin determins the size of an external avatar, which will be the maximum
     size for every avatar picture
8 - sticky messages - messages that always stay on top - only admin can create
     them, of course
9 - sorting of member list is now possible. Sorting according to each info
     that is available on the list - name, joined date, email etc., ascending and
     descending
10 - the maximum number of replies to a topic shown per page can be set
     by the admin. This takes care of issues where servers or links are slow.
11 - included "pdf" in the list of uploadable files (attachments)
12 - login process does no longer pass the encrypted password in the URL
13 - A member can now change his alias back to a value he used earlier. The
	alias will still be blocked for other users. This functions works only with aliases
	used after the application of this update, because there is no way to determine
	which alias has been used by which person
14 - HTML code can no longer be used to format the posts, instead, HTML and
	other code is made visible. This way, the board fits better for discussions about
	scripting and programming, and avoids destruction of the layout by wrong HTML
	code
15 - member can decide not to display other users avatars, to save bandwidth
16 - included a function to make sure that the program was updated properly
17 - Improved the list of latest visitors to show the last logged in visitor on top
	of the list
18 - included navigation links in the posts display, to be able to navigate easily
	in longer threads with multiple pages
19 - attachment file types can now be set by the admin (see doc)
20 - There will be no "No Subject" messages any more. If a message has
	no subject, the subject line will be made of the first words of the message

-------------------------
Fixed bugs in version 4.5:
-------------------------

1 - it seems that when a reply was edited, the last post date wasn't adjusted accordingly.
     This has been fixed now.
2 - on the entry page, last post's author and date wasn't updated when an entry
     was edited.
3 - When unbanning a user, his/her details were completely deleted and username
     was set to the admin's name. This fix has been published as version 4.1
4 - When login and confirmation of registration were required, the confirmation wouldn't
     work. This has been fixed
5 - alias is now used more consistently
6 - When post.php was called without parameters, it returned some ugly PHP-errors. This
     has been fixed.
7 - users who use a proxy will now also be able to log in without problems and while
     the IP-check is on (not tested, since I don't use a proxy)
8 - In a locked forum, the button at the bottom still allowed to create a new
     topic and caused a sometimes cryptic error message
9 - Files are now locked when written to to avoid confusion and faulty messages
10 - notification messages about replies are now in the language of the person who
	receives them
11 - PBLang tended to loose messages with increasing complexity. This problem
	was most likely caused by a mising lock to the files, when someone wrote a
	new post, a reply and so on. Now, a file is locked when it is written to and checked
	for any anomalities, so that no data should be lost any more.
12 - email to admin about new members will now be in the language of the board, and not in
	the new member's language
13 - animated smilies were not shown when replying to a message, even though the
	author of the reply had animated smilies enabled
14 - When the board is in maintenance mode, it shows now the correct message and
	does not say that the admin requires the visitor to log in.
15 - Membership list sorting by names was separated into lower and upper case words.
	That has been fixed.
16 - attachment link wasn't right.

******************************************************
New in version 4.51
-----------------------

1 - the use of PHP Accelerator on a server can cause problems with the way
	how PBLang writes to files - vertain variables weren't stored properly.
	The writing process was improved so that this kind of problem can't occur
	any more. This is not a bug in PBLang, but in PHP Accelerator.

-----------------------
Fixed bugs in version 4.51 and 4.52:
-----------------------

1 - The avatar picture wasn't shown when selected during registration
2 - two minor bugs in the install.php file have been fixed
3 - Finally solved the problem that quotes weren't working in the footer, so
	couldn't be included easily. This works now, also for the site title and
	motto.

******************************************************
	New in version 4.55
-----------------------

1 - HTML code design improved, more consistent use of styles
2 - Now the admin will see the real username of a member, in case the alias
	is different. The real username is shown in posts from that member
	underneath the alias.
3 - Search results now translate BB-codes
4 - When smilies or BBCodes aren't enabled, they won't show when a new
	topic or reply is created.
5 - provided a tool to make a list on a different page of latest posts.
6 - support for SMTP email, if PHP-email is not supported (see doc for more
	details)

******************************************************
	New in 4.58
-----------------------

1 - Now, [url=htpp://...]name of webpage[/url] is possible
2 - Now, [email=email@server.com]name of email owner[/email] is possible

----------------------
Fixed bugs in version 4.58
----------------------

1 - lanuage used for smileys and PBcode images wasn't set to member's
	language
2 - box for email notification appeared also when editing a message or
	reply, but wasn't really useful. It referred only to the original author's
	settings. This is now fixed - every responder can request notification and
	will be notified of posts, and this notification can also again be turned
	off by editing a post.
3 - Posting a message with neither a subject nor any content causes
	several PHP errors and wrong counter increments. Now, a PBLang error
	message will be shown.
4 - member could enter double quotes in user slogan, which would result
	in PHP errors. Such characters are now taken care of.
5 - It was possible to insert javascript code into the image BB-code. This
	is now no longer possible.
6 - If post.php was called with parameters which call for a non existing
	message, several PHP errors occured. Now, you'll see a clear error
	message produced by PBLang.

******************************************************
New in 4.59
-----------------------

1 - category and forum titles and descriptions can now contain BB-codes

-----------------------
Fixed bugs in version 4.59
----------------------

1 - No avatars were shown when only webavatars were disabled. Fixed.
2 - Even when web avatars weren't allowed, new members could choose it
	when registering. Fixed.
3 - Undoing email notification didn't work. It works now.
4 - When the alias was different from the username, it caused an "alias
	already in use" error, even though the alias wasn't used. Fixed.
5 - When a new forum was created and the first message was a sticky one,
	errors occured and one "new post" button didn't work
6 - Corrected a bug in GetLatestMessage.php which would cause it to produce
	errors when a recent message was deleted in the forum.

******************************************************
New in 4.6
-----------------------

1 - moderators may now also delete individual posts
2 - added a style called ar_grey_1 which uses the basic set of ar_grey,
	but takes into account some contrast problems (light text on dark
	background and vice versa)
3 - Modified "GetLatestMessage.php". The function will now return an
	array with information about a specified number of latest posts (as
	stored in the latestposts list). The call to this function is now slightly
	different from what it used to be:
	GetLatestMessage(str URL_to_forum,str basedir,int amount_of_messages_to_show)
4 - GetLatestMessage() now returns an array item to tell how many messages
	are actually available for display. This way there is no problem when too
	many messages were written in restricted forums. Check the file itself for
	details on how to use it.

-----------------------
Fixed bugs in version 4.6
----------------------

1 - PBCodes in the user slogan weren't translated. That is done now.
2 - Footer wasn't displayed right in the admin center (first call).
3 - URL BBCode wouldn't accept URLs beginning with https://
4 - fixed some interface inconsistencies
5 - PBCode img can now be nested within a URL-PBCode, so the image
	becomes a link to some URL.
6 - When confirmation of registration wasn't required, members could re-use
	the name of a deleted user.
7 - GetLatestMessage.php had various problems in 4.59
8 - When a user is banned, in profile it still showed the rank image as if
	he isn't banned.
9 - Fixed some problem with the notification email sent to admins - the
	mail was incomplete when notified about a reply in the forum
10 - within a thread, the bottom navigation wouldn't work properly.
11 - when messages were deleted which were in the latest messages list,
	the list grew smaller. This is fixed.
12 - messages which had been posted in a closed restricted forum
	were invisible in the latest messages list to members who don't have
	access to this forum saw accordingly less messages in the latest messages
	list. This has been fixed.
13 - The function GetLatestMessage() returned any message, also the ones
	from restricted forums. This won't happen any longer.
14 - The deletion of messages sometimes produced wrong info about
	latest posts and authors of latest posts. This should be fixed now.
15 - Censoring of bad words didn't work properly. This is now fixed.
16 - If an empty search form was submitted, it returned  numerous warnings.
	This has been fixed now.
17 - modifications to avoid PHP error messages when a wrong URL is entered

	which the thread was deleted
